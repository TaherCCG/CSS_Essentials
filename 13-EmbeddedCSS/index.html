    <p>Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance.</p>
    <p>Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.</p>
    <p>Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.</p>
    <p>The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.</p>
    <p>Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement.</p>
