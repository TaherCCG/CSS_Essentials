          What happens if we set the height for the element, but its content is higher than the value of that height? In other words, what happens when the content is bigger than the container? We can fix this problem with the overflow property. The overflow property controls the content that falls out of the boundaries of the container.

          If we set the value to auto, a scrollbar will be shown only if it is needed. In other words, it will show up if the content is larger than the container. In this case, a vertical scrollbar will be added on the right side of the container. On the other hand, the value of scroll will add the scrollbar whether it is needed or not, both horizontally and vertically

          Sometimes we want to clip out the content that is hanging out of the container. We want to hide it. If this is the case, then we need to set the value of hidden to the overflow property. But what if we want the content to be shown? If we donât mind that content is breaking out of the container? Then we should use the visible property:
